# Replicating Great Tits Weather Study
I am replicating the following study: "Weather effects on nestling survival of great tits vary according to the developmental stage" conducted by:
Fernando Marques-Santos, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais and
Niels J. Dingemanse,  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jav.02421
I am not affiliated with conducting the study or am or was a member of either university.
I am using python, pandas, and seaborn to graph the charts from Figure 2.
